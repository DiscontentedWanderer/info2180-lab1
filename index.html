    I don't make long term plans but in the here and now I strive do my best.<br> People who "know" me would describe me as reserved.My interest in web development stems from my interest to create interesting systems to solve various problems.<br>It is a way to improve my problem solving skills and have fun along the way. This is all for now. This is me.
